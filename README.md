# Power-System-Fault-Detection
Using IBM cloud lite and watsonx.ai Studio to Design a machine learning model to detect and classify various faults in a power distribution system. By analyzing electrical measurement data such as voltage and current phasors, the model distinguishes between normal operation and different fault types (line-to-ground, line-to-line, three-phase faults). The goal is to provide fast and accurate fault identification, essential for ensuring power grid stability and reliability.
